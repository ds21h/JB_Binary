Version 0.9 - 16-11-2022
- First version for beta test
- Known issue: generating on a larger playfield (8 X 10 or larger) can take a long time. Restarting the generation can solve this issue.

Version 1.0 - 08-04-2023
- Generate now starts 3 parallel tasks. The result of the first finished task is used and the remaining tasks are canceled.
  This is because generation is a cpu-intensive task that takes sometimes a long time. This fix limits the generation time issue.
