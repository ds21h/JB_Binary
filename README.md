# Binary

This is an Android Binary game. It should work on all versions of Android starting from Lollipop (5.0).

If you trust me feel free to download and install the .apk file.
You can also take the source as a basis to build your own game.

History

Version 1.0 - 08-04-2023
- Generate now starts 3 parallel tasks. The result of the first finished task is used and the remaining tasks are canceled.
  This is because generation is a cpu-intensive task that takes sometimes a long time. This fix limits the generation time issue.

Version 0.9 - 16-11-2022
- First version for beta test
- Known issue: generating on a larger playfield (8 X 10 or larger) can take a long time. Restarting the generation can solve this issue.
